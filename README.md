The purpose of a library management system is to operate a library with efficiency and at reduced costs. Moreover, the system being entirely automated may streamlines all the tasks involved in operations of the library. The library management system software makes the library a smart one by organizing the books systematically by author, title, and subject. This enables users to search for books quickly and effortlessly.
